Reality 


Reality is pretty weird word for my generation. people are influnced but reality but they hardly have control over their 
fantasies as well. I wish to create a world where reality meets expectations. Manipulation of moving reality and make it 
my own. Your own reality is best one can wish for. A simple device to attach urself with the new reality. Its definitely 
not metaverse. it cannot be cartoons or make believe animations. There is need for real life manupulation of reality with
the biggest impact. It has to be humans from real life taking shapes with ease in any reality. That would be the greatest
achievement in coming futures for generation of kids. I get 2 yr max to build this. I have to experiment with every 
manupultive device exisiting in the research and hidden technology in government. 

There are multiple paths to consider and connect the dots and iterate and start even with stepping stones. 

Choosing this as my pursuit into research for next 3years. How about a open source projectable interface for opensource 
hardware with patent rights lmao. could be a great project if i got it right? right! simple physics with optic devices or 
displays which can create charged particles or some sensor pick up and it has to show holographic project as 3D. 
Look inside more ideas of creating the 3D displays or some sensor to work with projections. even the smallest holographic
displays would be awesome. Look into this and brainstorm this bish. 

I should study neuroscience, hci, electronics fs, even graphics cs subjects, optic physics, ar/vr/mr technologies, robotics stuff.

To  explore,
There can be variety of haptics designs or instead of focusing on small devices, more multiple sensing haptics would 
be great to look into. Materials have so much properties which can be exploits via electonics to use such as a sensor.

[New task]
A simulation software for 3D visualization of any 3D object
    - requires knowledge of Computer Graphics topics 
    - idea is that it loads a file, shows the render of the object in a interative space just rotation and stuff
    - now the next idea from this will be creation of hologram from that 2d screen representation
      - if the entire 3d object is shown as 1D image with particular coloring/grading to provide the depth information 
    - next would be creating a hardware to achieve this
      -  there are multiple ideas as to how to achieve this but requires alot of resources
      -  use a mouse trackpad for playing with the hologram in the new hardware, find new external ways of interation as HCI if its a closed box hologram like telerobotics stuff 
      -  new wireless actuators or something
